# JGrove

RaspberryPi+GrovePi Java library, licensed under the MIT License (MIT).

Initially based on the jgrove code from the "Captain Picar" project by Johannes Bergmann (jbman): https://github.com/jbman/captain-picar -- but mostly rewritten to add missing sensors and to be similar to the C# implementation of GrovePi: https://github.com/DexterInd/GrovePi.
